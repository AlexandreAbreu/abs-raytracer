Very simple raytracer.

Mostly started as a way to have fun & see how far I can go w/ a this and
to work on two things I like (scheme & graphic rendering) in the same
project.

Right now it is very slow, very ugly and mostly hacky.

It supports:
 - sphere / plane rendering,
 - multiple lights,
 - diffuse color & reflected rays,
 - shadows,
